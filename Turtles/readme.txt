in order for this to work, you would have to create a python file called "config_real".
in this file, using the twitter api, you would have the following:


api_key = **YOUR API KEY**
api_key_secret = **YOUR API SECRET KEY**
bearer_token = **YOUR BEARER TOKEN**
access_token = **YOUR ACCESS TOKEN**
access_token_secret = **YOUR ACCESS TOKEN SECRET**

all of these are available to you to create your own twitter application at :
